HYPER 6 FAQ

Q: What is this pile of shit?
A: Hyper 6 is the sixth installment in the Hyper Mari World series by Haimari. It was released in 2010, and is notable for its difficulty. It is very unfair, has long sections without midways, and is riddled with blind jumps as well as offscreen enemies/sprites. There is a large difficulty spike in World 6, and an even bigger one in World 8.

Q: Did you lose a bet? Are you retarded? Do you hate yourself? Why are you playing this?
A: No. Yes. Yes. I am playing this for fun. I am under no obligations whatsoever. I hope to complete any% within a reasonable span of time.

Q: Do you know what you're getting yourself into? Are you aware of the scope of how horrible this romhack is?
A: Does anyone, really?

Q: Why don't you have your microphone on? Do you really think people want to watch some dip shit suck at Mario without any commentary whatsoever?
A: There are a multitude of reasons. If you've seen how badly I play Super Mario World while trying to talk to chat, you would know that it is just not possible to beat a game such as this one with the lack of skill presented. As well as the aforementioned point, I also simply do not have enough content. I believe it would be a much more enjoyable experience to merely listen to a playlist of well-selected music, rather than hearing me say 'Ahh, fuck..' every time I trip over my shoelaces and stumble into a bottomless pit.

Q: Why do you keep running into the same enemy over and over? Are you a fucking moron?
A: I have very poor short-term memory, and sometimes I distrust my muscle memory. It leads to me knowing that I should press a button at a certain point, but looking at the surroundings and thinking "I don't HAVE to do that, I could just do this easier thing instead." which immediately leads to death, and sudden realization of why said muscle memory exists.

Q: Why did you just jump into a pit? You realize those kill you, right?
A: I can almost guarantee I meant to land on solid ground, but ultimately failed. For that, I apologize.

Q: How long are you going to play this?
A: I intend on completing Abyssal Bowser, the final level of World 8.

Q: Do you plan on attempting to beat special world?
A: I am quite a fan of Haimari balls. We'll see.

Q: What are your thoughts on the game so far?
A: As of 5/17/2020, nearing completion of World 3: It is quite fun, I am enjoying it thoroughly. I am aware I will come to regret this decision. But as for now.. I like it. :)

Q: What is the song currently playing?
A: I suggest you either look up the lyrics, or browse through the playlist. You could try asking me in chat, but if you happen to inquire during something such as 'Can You Feel The Sunshine,' where half of the lyrics are literally the song's title, you will be getting nothing from me but disappointment.

Q: Why are you manually posting the link to this page in chat? Do you not know what a bot is, or are you just too stupid to use one?
A: I don't feel like relying on someone else's creation to distribute my information. 

Q: This music is giving me testicular cancer. Can I request a song?
A: You may do literally anything, including posting whatever garbage you want me to listen to. I'll play it on stream if it doesn't suck massive horsecock.

Q: You realize FAQ stands for 'Frequently Asked Questions,' right? Who is asking all of these questions?
A: It's a colloquialism, you sack of shit.

Q: May I slob on your dingus?
A: ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY.
